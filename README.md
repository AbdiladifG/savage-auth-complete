## How It's Made:
The Public Forum is built using the following technologies:

- **MongoDB**: Used as the database to store unique user, message, and likes data.
The core functionality is implemented on the server side using CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

**Key Packages Used:**

- **mongoose**: Facilitates interaction with MongoDB.
